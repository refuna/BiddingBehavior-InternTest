# Bidding Behavior Project

## Overview

The **Bidding Behavior Project** is a Kaggle competition that seeks to analyze and predict patterns in online auction bidding behavior. By understanding how users participate in bidding, we aim to model and predict factors that lead to successful bids, identify potential fraudulent behavior, and study bidding strategies across different user groups.

The competition provides a dataset containing detailed records of bid history in various online auctions, along with features that describe both the users and the auctions.

## Dataset

### Data Description

The dataset contains records of online auction bids made by users. It includes the following key fields:

- **Auction ID**: Unique identifier for each auction.
- **Bidder ID**: Unique identifier for each bidder.
- **Bid Amount**: The amount of money bid by a user.
- **Bid Time**: Timestamp of when the bid was placed.
- **Device Information**: Information about the device used to place the bid (e.g., mobile, desktop).
- **Country**: Location of the user placing the bid.
- **Outcome**: Whether the bid was successful or not.


### Data Sources

The data is provided by an online auction platform and includes anonymized information to protect user privacy. The dataset is designed to allow for predictive modeling, as well as to study patterns related to both legitimate and fraudulent bidding behavior.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are:
- **Predict Winning Bids**: Build a model to predict the likelihood of a bid being successful in an auction.
- **Detect Fraud**: Identify patterns indicative of fraudulent or suspicious bidding behavior.
- **Study Bidding Strategies**: Analyze different bidding strategies, such as last-minute bidding, and how these influence auction outcomes.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Investigate time-dependent factors, such as the time of day, bid timing relative to auction end, and their effect on winning bids.
